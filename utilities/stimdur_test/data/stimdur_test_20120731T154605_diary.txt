PTB-INFO: Broken Apple OS/X 10.7 or later detected: Using CoreVideo timestamping instead of precise vbl-irq timestamping.
PTB-INFO: Implausible measured vblank endline 1050 indicates that the beamposition query workaround should be used for your GPU.
PTB-INFO: Enabling the beamposition workaround, as explained in 'help ConserveVRAM', section 'kPsychUseBeampositionQueryWorkaround'.
PTB-INFO: The detected endline of the vertical blank interval is equal or lower than the startline. This indicates
PTB-INFO: that i couldn't detect the duration of the vertical blank interval and won't be able to correct timestamps
PTB-INFO: for it. This will introduce a very small and constant offset (typically << 1 msec). Read 'help BeampositionQueries'
PTB-INFO: for how to correct this, should you really require that last few microseconds of precision.
PTB-INFO: Btw. this can also mean that your systems beamposition queries are slightly broken. It may help timing precision to
PTB-INFO: enable the beamposition workaround, as explained in 'help ConserveVRAM', section 'kPsychUseBeampositionQueryWorkaround'.


PTB-INFO: OpenGL-Renderer is NVIDIA Corporation :: NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M OpenGL Engine :: 2.1 NVIDIA-8.0.51
PTB-INFO: Renderer has 512 MB of VRAM and a maximum 477 MB of texture memory.
PTB-INFO: VBL startline = 1050 , VBL Endline = 1050
PTB-INFO: Measured monitor refresh interval from beamposition = 16.699138 ms [59.883332 Hz].
PTB-INFO: Will use beamposition query for accurate Flip time stamping.
PTB-INFO: Measured monitor refresh interval from VBLsync = 16.684297 ms [59.936599 Hz]. (77 valid samples taken, stddev=0.199568 ms.)
PTB-INFO: Small deviations between reported values are normal and no reason to worry.
PTB-INFO: Support for fast OffscreenWindows enabled.

INFO: PTB's Screen('Flip', 10) command seems to have missed the requested stimulus presentation deadline
INFO: a total of 15 times out of a total of 67 flips during this session.

INFO: This number is fairly accurate (and indicative of real timing problems in your own code or your system)
INFO: if you provided requested stimulus onset times with the 'when' argument of Screen('Flip', window [, when]);
INFO: If you called Screen('Flip', window); without the 'when' argument, this count is more of a ''mild'' indicator
INFO: of timing behaviour than a hard reliable measurement. Large numbers may indicate problems and should at least
INFO: deserve your closer attention. Cfe. 'help SyncTrouble', the FAQ section at www.psychtoolbox.org and the
INFO: examples in the PDF presentation in PsychDocumentation/Psychtoolbox3-Slides.pdf for more info and timing tips.
