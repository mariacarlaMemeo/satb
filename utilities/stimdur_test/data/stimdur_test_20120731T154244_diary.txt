PTB-INFO: Broken Apple OS/X 10.7 or later detected: Using CoreVideo timestamping instead of precise vbl-irq timestamping.
PTB-INFO: Implausible measured vblank endline 1050 indicates that the beamposition query workaround should be used for your GPU.
PTB-INFO: Enabling the beamposition workaround, as explained in 'help ConserveVRAM', section 'kPsychUseBeampositionQueryWorkaround'.
PTB-INFO: The detected endline of the vertical blank interval is equal or lower than the startline. This indicates
PTB-INFO: that i couldn't detect the duration of the vertical blank interval and won't be able to correct timestamps
PTB-INFO: for it. This will introduce a very small and constant offset (typically << 1 msec). Read 'help BeampositionQueries'
PTB-INFO: for how to correct this, should you really require that last few microseconds of precision.
PTB-INFO: Btw. this can also mean that your systems beamposition queries are slightly broken. It may help timing precision to
