PTB-INFO: Broken Apple OS/X 10.7 or later detected: Using CoreVideo timestamping instead of precise vbl-irq timestamping.
PTB-INFO: Implausible measured vblank endline 1050 indicates that the beamposition query workaround should be used for your GPU.
PTB-INFO: Enabling the beamposition workaround, as explained in 'help ConserveVRAM', section 'kPsychUseBeampositionQueryWorkaround'.
PTB-INFO: The detected endline of the vertical blank interval is equal or lower than the startline. This indicates
PTB-INFO: that i couldn't detect the duration of the vertical blank interval and won't be able to correct timestamps
PTB-INFO: for it. This will introduce a very small and constant offset (typically << 1 msec). Read 'help BeampositionQueries'
PTB-INFO: for how to correct this, should you really require that last few microseconds of precision.
PTB-INFO: Btw. this can also mean that your systems beamposition queries are slightly broken. It may help timing precision to

PTB-INFO: OpenGL-Renderer is NVIDIA Corporation :: NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M OpenGL Engine :: 2.1 NVIDIA-8.0.51
PTB-INFO: Renderer has 512 MB of VRAM and a maximum 477 MB of texture memory.
PTB-INFO: VBL startline = 1050 , VBL Endline = 1050
PTB-INFO: Measured monitor refresh interval from beamposition = 16.699105 ms [59.883449 Hz].
PTB-INFO: Will use beamposition query for accurate Flip time stamping.
