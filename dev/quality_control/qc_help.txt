Instructions for performing Quality Control processing 
on SIGNALS experiment data:

Open a file from the file-list on the right side of the QC Panel window by double-clicking it.

Step 1: Evaluate Response Times
- Press the Plot Response Time button.
- Two graphs will appear. You are looking for times that seem either way too fast (anything under 250 
milliseconds is too fast because the person is incapable of processing the faces in such a short time) or 
too slow (something over 5000 suggests that the person was taking a break and not paying attention to 
responding correctly). 
- To exclude short or long responses, type values to the Min. RT or Max RT text-boxes. Press return to 
apply the changes. You can press the Plot button again to see the changes.

Step 2: Locate learning peak/plateau
- Press the Plot Block 1 Performance button.
- Look at the graph to see where it appears the person's sensitivity to the task maximized or appeared 
to level off. You should notice that the graph rises and then meets some maximum that appears to 
remain somewhat stable before it drops off. In the last trials the sensitivity fluctuates a lot; thats why 
there is such a big drop off near the end. 
- Usually people's sensitivity maximizes sometime around trial 100-150. It varies by subject. 
- Once you have found the trial number that seems to be the peak in their learning, enter that value in 
the Start Trial# box and press return.

Step 3: Fine-tune the response threshold location
- Press the Plot Button Presses button. You will be prompted to match up a few ambiguous data points 
(X11 goes with Y11, etc.). Do this and press OK. 
- Press the Plot Threshold button.
- Ideally the threshold should be a nice sigmoid or "S" shape. If this is not the case you may want to 
eliminate some of the button presses that are changing flattening the S shape. 
- It is tempting to trim the data a lot to make the S threshold look better, but as a rule of thumb it's ok 
to eliminate points at stimuli 1 & 2 and 10 & 11, but it becomes a little less obvious when to remove 
points as you get closer to the more central stimuli because the faces become less recognizable as 
more or less threatening; it is hard to know if the participant made a mistake or actually couldn't tell 
what the face was. Use your best judgement and use the threshold graph to help you.
- To remove a response data-point, go back to the Button Presses graph and use the Paint Brush tool to 
highlight the desired point (it should turn red). Right click on the highlighted point and choose "Replace 
with > NaNs".
- Press the Refresh Threshold button to see how replacing the value has changed the shape and 
inflection point of the graph. 
-When you are satisfied, press the Save button.

Next, for experiments that have more than one block of conditions, move on to the next 
blocks/conditions for the current participant. Repeat the above 3 steps. Remember to save after each 
block. 

If you decide to stop working keep track of the file/block in which you left off because you might have 
to use another computer and you won't know where you left off.

Hope this is helpful,
