function get_signal
%FUNCTION get_signal. Indended to be called as a list-file xfn by show_time>load_stim
%Calls fetch_signal to obtain a source = posobjtype or negobjtype, with probability = alpha
% and a sigval = value# (on x-axis sensory domain) of stim to be shown: the stim number. 
% Don't confuse sigval with the experimental block's current
% trial number in stiminfo or with the value of a payoff.
% Overwrites these items in global "stiminfo", which is then processed in show_stim.
% 
%CHANGE LOG:
% 1/10/11 - moved code to update stimulus duration (in stiminfo) with targetStim_dur 
%           from here (fetch_signal, following other updates to stiminfo) to main expt code, where it needs to be used
%           (show stim doesn't have access to the global stiminfo, just a local version that get's applied to ALL stims).
% 
% 1/15/11 - depricated older version. Now uses global struct siganl_params for
%           all values. Incorporated assign_signal into this code.
% 
% 2/7/11  - mods for new stiminfo structure, load_stim
%         - renamed this m-file "get_signal" from "fetch_signal".
%         - moved assign_signal out (again) to separate mfile (which is now known as fetch_signal)
%         - replaced calls to depricated xtrial (from old loadstim) with conditions.xtrial, which is set in main block_trials
%         - would be nice to make this independent of conditions.xtrial
% 
% 8/1/11 - added conditions.stimID=stimnum. Useful for stims, like Gabors,
%          where Stimulus field doesn't specify a unique signal ID (see utd.m expt use of Gabors).
